    This site was designed using pre-written code all collected from Bootstrap. As the 2nd assignment in the 6-month long coding bootcamp at University of Washington, I was instructed to take my first portfolio and remake it from previously written code on Bootstrap.
    This was a fun project because it reminded me of my days when I would do the same process to design my MySpace profile.

  <p>As a recent graduate of the Supply Chain Management program at Western Washington University, I've turned to web development to supplement my ever-growing skillset. I'm currently enrolled in a 6-month full-stack web development program at the University of Washington and look forward to diving into the vast library of tools and communities to develop my coding sills.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy catching Sounders games, trying new beers, and hitting up new food spots throughout Seattle. I love travelling and seeing new cities. Over the next few months, I will be creating projects and sharing them on this site to document my experience as well as seek feedback from you. I'm always happy to meet new people and love to get insight into other's experiences. If you're up for a cup coffee, let's chat! Cheers.</p>
